# STAT 545B Assignments

By: Catalina Gonzalez Prieto

The repository [Assignments_CatalinaGonzalez](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/Assignments_CatalinaGonzalez) was created under the [stat545ubc-2021 GitHub account](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021)  to complete the [assignment B-1](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b1/) for the [STAT545 2021 course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/;). The goals of this project are to make, document and test a function using packages such as: `dplyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for visualization, and `testthat` to test functions.    

## Folders and documents on the repository:    

1.  **Assignment-B-1_files/figure-gfm:** folder containing the graphs of assignment B-1    

2. **Assignment B-1.Rmd:** contains the code used for assignment B-1.    

3. **Assignment-B-1.md:** friendly visualization of the code used in assignment B-1.    

**README:** contains a description of the project    

## How to run the code?    

Markdown (`.md`) and RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) files can be opened and modified using any text editor. However, using Rstudio you can have a more friendly visualization of the code and render it to different file types such as `html` or `pdf` using `Preview` in markdown documents or `Knit` in RMarkdown documents.
